0.0.6  2006/03/12
       - Changed the calling syntax from ->new(%hash) to ->new($callback)
         because with current updates, there is only need for a single
         attr
       - Added eConnect, eDisconnect that do the right thing when connecting
         to TWS 
       - added all the EClientSocket methods to tws, so you don't have to 
         know how to get at those methods

         arount the user's filesystem
