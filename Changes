Revision history for Finance-InteractiveBrokers-TWS

0.1.0  2008/08/03

    - Kinda ripped it apart and rebuilt using a way to dynamically 
      learn about the EWrapper and create corresponding code.
    - Made it more logically to request objects directly from IB's Java
      rather than having code in this module

    - Added method tickOptionComputation

0.0.6  2006/03/12

    - Changed the calling syntax from ->new(%hash) to ->new($callback)
      because with current updates, there is only need for a single attr
    - Added eConnect, eDisconnect that do the right thing when connecting
      to TWS 
    - added all the EClientSocket methods to tws, so you don't have to 
      know how to get at those methods

      arount the user's filesystem
