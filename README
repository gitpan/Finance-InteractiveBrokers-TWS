Finance-InteractiveBrokers-TWS 

This module lets you communicate with InteractiveBroker's (IB) Trader's Work 
Station (TWS), using Perl.  This is accomplished by wrapping the Java API that
IB provides in Perl using Inline::Java.  Since we are using the Java API 
provided by IB, all functionality is available.

IB uses an event based model for communicating with the TWS, that is once 
you've connected TWS will send messages (events) that you need to handle in 
your code.

PREREQUISTES

    * TWS installed and running somewhere upon your network
    
    * Java JDK/JRE version >= 1.5 installed locally - if you have less 
      there is a workaround.
    
    * TWS Java API provided by IB installed locally 
      (see: http://www.interactivebrokers.com/cgi-pub/unix_standalone_api.pl)
      
    * You must compile the Java source files in the API to Java class files
    
        $ cd /the/location/of/IBJts/java/com/ib/client/
        $ javac *.java

    * Inline::Java installed
